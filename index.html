                A 2D video game inspired by "Xtank". This game was built using swing
                for UX and java.net for multiplayer. Any number of players on the same wifi
                can compete. The host will type "/HOST", and the other players
                will type "/JOIN the host's ip adress". The game includes 3 different clouds
                and two maps. Click <a href="Xcloud.jar">here</a>to download.
                Xcloud requires the latest version of Java.
